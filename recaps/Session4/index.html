<h1 id="4-zarantyr">4 Zarantyr</h1>
<h2 id="slumming-it">Slumming It</h2>
<p>Having been briefed by Elaydren d'Cannith and outfitted for the task ahead, the group heads out to find the E-213 Valve Cluster somewhere in Dorasharn Tower in the Malleon's Gate district of Lower Dura. Arriving at Dorasharn Tower the group begins to look for the entrance to the sewers but isn't having much luck. They eventually find a staircase that appears to lead downward, maybe to the sewers? Ultimately they discover it leads to a tailor's shop, the sign above the door reads Nibbur's Fine Tailoring.</p>
<p>Nibbur's shop is an oasis of calm in the district. His clothes, though primarily designed for globinoids, are well made and bear a distinctive style - Caelin is even able to pick out some glammerweave amongst some of the nicest outfits on display. They also notice that behind his counter appears to be a large rusted metal door - maybe what they are looking for?</p>
<p>They question Nibbur, first complimenting his goods and Cassian even placing an order for a custom set of clothes, which seems to please him and make him more open. He shares that he doesn't know where the E-213 Valve Cluster is or what is behind the door as he has never had a reason to find out. He gives them permission to try and open the door, as long as they are careful with his goods.</p>
<p>Cassian is able to force the door open; S.A.M., using his lantern, and Cligs, using her darkvision, inspect the room beyond. It appears to be a large room (roughly 150ft diameter) that is filled with water until about 50ft below them. The smell wafting out is vile and makes Nibbur back away - regretting his choice to let them open it. Looking more carefully they determine that the liquid is more sludge than water and that, suspiciously, the walls appear remarkably clean and free of any kind of grime or fungus. Cligs tosses a scrap piece of fabric into the liquid and notices that it begins to sizzle - not a path they want to take!</p>
<p>While examining this room and discussing the outcome, the group hears a loud banging coming down the stairs followed by a massive bugbear shadowing the entrance. He enters the shop and begins yelling, banging on the counter, and demanding his outfit from Nibbur. Nibbur tries to explain to Mandy that they aren't ready yet and signals to the party to intervene. S.A.M. doesn't seem to want to get involved and is ready to leave the goblin to his fate when Nibbur says he might know someone who can help with their issue. Finally they talk to Mandy and are able to convince him to comeback tomorrow, giving Nibbur time to figure out a solution. Grateful for their help, he tells them that there is a goblin merchant named Skakan who operates out of a nearby Rat's Market and finds most of his "treasures" by exploring the sewers - if anyone would know where the Valve Cluster is it would be him.</p>
<h2 id="the-rats-market">The Rat's Market</h2>
<p>Following Nibbur's directions they make their way to an open square amidst the tight tunnels of the district. Here they come upon a merchant loudly advertising him goods spread out over several blankets. A crowd is around him. The group approach and attempt to talk to him but he is focused on making sales. Cligs buys a rusty bell in attempt to get Skakan's attention on them and ask about the Valve Cluster. Skakan says he might know where that is - for 100 silver. They try to haggle but aren't successful and end up paying what he asks. He gives them directions.</p>
<h2 id="no-one-will-notice-the-pile-of-corpses">No one will notice the pile of corpses...</h2>
<p>Following Skakan's directions the group locates a door marked E-213 Valve Cluster and open it. They take a more cautious posture, for a change, and carefully descend into the sewer. They spot an alcove above the landing at the bottom of the stairs and decide to check it out. Caelin does uppies for Cligs who surprises the warforged that was hiding there to ambush them. Glaive strikes at, but misses, Cligs and demands the journal in exchange for their lives. The group chooses violence and in short order is able to eliminate Glaive and the two shifters that were working for him. Luckily for the group, they are able to intercept his Final Messenger. S.A.M. helpfully (?) piles the corpses in the alcove where Glaive was hiding and then attempts to read the Final Messenger. Having never done this before he doesn't know how to navigate using it but is able to determine from it that Glaive was sending his last moments and location to a superior located in the city, named Saber.</p>
<h2 id="lets-be-more-careful">Let's be more careful</h2>
<p>Continuing on following the map that Elaydren gave them they are able to navigate the sewers and eventually come upon a circular metal hatch engraved with arcane runes and a similar mithral symbol as to the one that is on the journal. Abandoning their previous caution, Cligs shoots the door with a <em>firebolt</em> - triggering an acid spray trap that hurts her, Caelin, and S.A.M. Eventually Caelin figures out that the symbol on the journal and door match and appear to be made of the same material. They use <em>mage hand</em> to hold the journal up the symbol on the door and it disarms the arcane wards and the door slides open. The group takes time to rest before heading out and Cligs sets an <em>alarm</em> on the doorway.</p>
<h2 id="creepy-crawlies">Creepy crawlies</h2>
<p>Navigating the steep shaft, it eventually evens out into a sort of tunnel which finally opens into what feels like a massive cavern completely cloaked in darkness. Caelin communes with the local fungi and asks them to sporulate where there is danger. The group see that most of the ground in front of them seems to be covered with mushroom spurt. Cassian tosses a torch out into the area to see what happens and in the immediate area around the torch the mushroom activity dies down.</p>
<p>Exploring the cavern the group sees that the creature being repelled by the fire appears to be a swarm of large hungry looking beetles. They also come upon a trio of large rats that Cligs tosses a ration to which takes their attention. Eventually they come upon one building that appears more intact, clean, and doesn't seem to have any critters near it. Entering this building Caelin is truck with a feeling of familiarity and investigating further is able to determine this is an ancient temple to Onatar, the god of artifice and the forge. Cligs searches the building further and finds a remarkably intact font which is filled with a crystal clear fluid. She takes a drink and is overcome with a feeling of rest - the liquid grants the benefit of a long rest. Caelin also takes a drink and Cassian bottles the remaining dose up for later. S.A.M. shares some interesting views on the Sovereign and the faithful...</p>
<h2 id="poor-iron-doggos">Poor iron doggos</h2>
<p>Continuing to explore the cavern the group eventually comes up another building that seems to be remarkably in good shape. It also appears to be sealed by metal doors. Exploring around the building they do find that it might be possible to get onto the roof. First, Caelin tries to open the door and Cassian tries to alley-oop onto the roof with a boost from S.A.M. - both attempts are unsuccessful. Using the rubble around it they are able to climb onto the roof and find that one section has a hole in it from rocks that fell onto it. Examining the rubble they see that an metal dog was crushed by the falling debris. Clearing some of the debris to examine it they find that a pentagonal rod is sticking out of his head.</p>
<p>While they are investigating this, Caelin notices two pairs of red eyes watching them from the other side of the building - two more iron dogs - that attack the party. They both initially go after Cligs, who is closest to them, but as they get close to her they seem to decide to ignore her and focus on the others. The group tries to find a way to deactivate or at least convince the Iron Defenders that they aren't a threat but they discern that these creatures are bound by ancient commands to protect this foundry and they don't have the skills or knowledge to command them. During the fight Cligs' <em>alarm</em> goes off. Realizing they have no other choice, they eliminate the two defenders and as each is defeated a circular and square rod is ejected from their heads.</p>
<h2 id="fat-loots">Fat loots</h2>
<p>The party is able to figure out that the three rods are keys and find the corresponding key holes on the wall. Learning their lesson from earlier, they also realize that the keys are trapped and they need to be entered in the correct order or else trigger the trap. They luckily figure out that the keys go in order circle, square, pentagon and the door opens. Between the foundry and the secret vault they recover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 suit of scale mail, 3 shields, 1 mace, and 1 longsword of mundane quality worth 100 gp total</li>
<li>Two magic items they are unclear on:</li>
<li>a cleverly-made chain shirt</li>
<li>a well-made rapier that has a flame motif down the blade</li>
<li>a sack of 100 pre-Galifar silver coins</li>
<li>a sack of 100 pre-Galifar gold coins,</li>
<li>4 gold ingots each worth 50 gp,</li>
<li>3 <em>potions of greater healing</em>, 1 <em>potion of fire resistance</em>,</li>
<li>an old map that shows a number of cryptic symbols spread throughout what appears to be ancient depictions of the territory now divided between the Mournland and Darguun</li>
<li>and the schema they came for.</li>
</ul>
