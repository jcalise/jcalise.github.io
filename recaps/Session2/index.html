            <h3 id="to-terminus-if-we-survive">To Terminus! If we survive...</h3>
            <p>Alden d'Orien has taken his son and left Sharn to help the boy recuperate. The group knows that they need
              to get to Terminus to find the excavated items and stop Garra. Asking Vishtai about the best way to get
              there, he points them in the direction of Lyrandar Tower, where they can make use of Alden's private
              skycoach to take them to Terminus.</p>
            <p>On their way to the tower, while crossing one of the bridges, they hear a familiar voice above them
              asking if they need a lift. Sergeant Vilroy is there with a skycoach of her own and she encourages the
              group to get on and fill her in. They at first seem hesitant to board but still fill her in on what they
              have been up to since they last met. She again encourages them to board and she will take them to
              Terminus. Cligs begins to notice that something doesn't seem quite right with "Vilroy" and begins
              questioning their paramour about their recent rendezvouses. At first "Vilroy" seems to be able to bluff
              their way through, but on sustained questioning they are flummoxed and instead of confronting the
              character they choose to jump off the skycoach - luckily clutching a <em>feather token</em> so they are
              able to safely escape to a lower level. They catch a fleeting glimpse as this impersonator melds into the
              crowd and notice that their shape has changed - a changeling. What happened to the real Vilroy?</p>
            <p>They get back on the trek to find the Orien Skycoach when they are again ambushed by agents of Daask, a
              quartet of gnolls riding disks of green energy zip between the towers and close in on them. Though the
              battle takes its toll on them, the group is able to eliminate 3 of the gnolls in short order and the last
              one flees.</p>
            <p>Surely these issues aren't a sign of things to come...</p>
            <h3 id="terminus">Terminus</h3>
            <p>Finally tracking down the Orien Skycoach and proving to the driver that they are on House Orien business,
              they are able to make their way to the top floor of Terminus. Terminus, in Lower Tavick's Landing, is
              named for Terminus Station, a massive House Orien enclave that serves as the endpoint for the Orien
              lightning rail. It bustles with crowds, pickpockets, con artists, and other criminals looking to take
              advantage of the city's visitors.</p>
            <p>Trying to get to Garra as quickly as possible, the group tries to engage the nearby Sharn Watch in
              helping in their search, or at least stopping the trains, or maybe directions....anything? Though the
              guard is too frightened by the prospect of mixing with Daask to get involved himself he does give them
              directions to the floor where Garra's apartment is located and says he will send word to other Watch
              stations to be on the lookout for the half-ogress.</p>
            <h3 id="she-isnt-getting-her-deposit-back">She isn't getting her deposit back</h3>
            <p>The group knocks on a series of apartment door but most don't answer. At one of them, an elderly
              magewright named Martisha shouts at them to go away. Convincing her to hear them out and persuading her to
              give them information she informs them that Garra is her neighbor and there has been a lot of commotion in
              the apartment today and she would appreciate it if they kept it down.</p>
            <p>The group circles back and is eventually able to get the door open. While exploring they are ambushed by
              four kenku assassins. In the midst of fighting the kenku are also joined by Nur, a gnoll who was in the
              other room of the apartment burning documents. The group endures another pitched battle but are thankfully
              aided by the timely arrival of members of the Watch. Exploring the apartment after the battle the group
              finds:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A badly battered Sergeant Vilroy, who has been rendered unconscious by <em>oil of taggit</em></li>
              <li>Records of the warforged that were employed in the excavation project</li>
              <li>A ticket stub indicating that Garra is leaving on a lightning rail to Wroat in 2 hours</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Having been roused by a handy Goodberry, the real Vilroy encourages them to quickly rest up and then get
              after Garra. She lets them know that there is a lift that will take them to the station level.</p>
            <h3 id="who-designed-this-adventure">Who designed this adventure?</h3>
            <p>Vilroy also reminds them to be mindful of more Daask operatives which proves to be an apt warning. They
              almost immediately encounter a Harpy who attempts to lure them and a group of commoners into jumping over
              the end of a sky bridge. Luckily most of the group is able to resist her Song and save Cligs and the
              commoners and defeat the Harpy. They have another run in with a Daask shifter named Bartram and his worg
              companion but are luckily able to buy their way out of having to fight them. The room that Bartram was
              guarding also has a halfling tied to a chair who has clear been beaten for information. He initially
              claims to not know why he is there but eventually confesses to being a Boromar spy that was trying (and
              failed) to infiltrate Daask. They free him, learn his name is Corrin and he points them towards the lift
              to the station level.</p>
            <h3 id="garra-finally">Garra, finally</h3>
            <p>Having made it to the station platform, the group hears the last call announcement for the lightning rail
              to Wroat. They are quickly able to accomplish:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Securing standard fare tickets on the same train</li>
              <li>Learn that the first class car has been rented out completely by a half-ogre who has paid for security
                and privacy, the car is off limits</li>
              <li>Determine that they need to find a way through both a dinning and a galley car to get to Garra</li>
              <li>Observe that, if necessary, it would be possible to climb out and on top of the cars</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Boarding the train the group attempts to look for Daask sleeper agents but doesn't immediately identify
              any. Making their way into the dinning car they are seated and start coming up with a plan....or plans?
              Finally settling on attempting to threaten/convince Garra into giving over the stolen goods. They are able
              to convince the waitress to deliver a note, a bottle of wine, and a slice of cherry cobbler to Garra.
              After a lengthy wait, she returns to say that Garra will see them and escorts them to her - ultimately
              locking them into the car with her.</p>
            <p>The conversation goes back and forth between her trying to convince them to either take a bribe to look
              the other way or join Daask and the group trying to get her to give up. With the group shielding her
              actions, Cligs is able to cast Sleep on Garra and they get the drop on her. Unbeknownst to them, her
              invisible Sprite, Rot, has been watching and immediately takes aim at the group. He isn't long for this
              world as Caelin is able to quickly dispatch him and the group turns their attention back to Garra. In what
              seems like a completely one-sided battle, a lucky change of pace from their previous encounters, the group
              is able to quickly and decisively deal with her. They are able to get her chest open and examine it's
              contents:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A collection of books and schemas, the items stolen from the excavation site</li>
              <li>A <em>feather token</em></li>
              <li>600gp</li>
              <li>A <em>gem of brightness</em> with 32 charges</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="admonition magic-item">
              <p class="admonition-title">Gem of Brightness</p>
              <p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p>
              <p>This prism has 32 charges. While you are holding it, you can take action and use one of three command
                words to cause one of the following effects:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>First Command Word. The gem sheds Bright Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional
                  30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you take a Bonus Action to repeat the
                  command word or until you use another function of the gem.</li>
                <li>Second Command Word. You expend 1 charge and cause the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one
                  creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
                  saving throw or have the Blinded condition for 1 minute. The creature repeats the save at the end of
                  each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
                <li>Third Command Word. You expend 5 charges and cause the gem to flare with intense light in a
                  30-foot Cone. Each creature in the Cone makes a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the
                  second command word.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 GP.</p>
