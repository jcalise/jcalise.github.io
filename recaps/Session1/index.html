<h1 id="session-1-1-2-zarantyr-998-yk">Session 1: 1-2 Zarantyr 998 YK</h1>
<h3 id="rooftop-rendezvous">Rooftop Rendezvous</h3>
<p>Sergeant Germaine Vilroy, of the Sharn City Watch, is waiting at the top of Lyrandar Tower, Upper Central District for her contacts to arrive so she can give them their mission. Cassian ir'Bellona, S.A.M., and Caelin arrive via airship. Moments later the two Sharn locals, Renée and Cligs, arrive via skycoach. They each introduce themselves and Vilroy gives them the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>A warforged named Coal had reached out to report a crime being committed in Old Sharn.</li>
<li>She wants the party to meet with Coal first and see if what she says adds up. She is worried that, with her status as a Watch sergeant, her presence will call undue attention and endanger Coal.</li>
<li>She offers them 25gp upfront and another 25gp for completing the mission</li>
<li>She setup a meeting place at the Cog Carnival in High Walls, Lower Tavick's Landing</li>
<li>She has set them up in an inn in Middle Dura, called Gallanda Hall</li>
<li>She has provided a writ of enforcement to the group to show that they are on official business</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon further pressing her for information, she also reveals:</p>
<ul>
<li>That she is on the take from the Boromar Clan and they are interested in what is happening in Old Sharn</li>
<li>She is trying to avoid getting the City Watch in the middle of a conflict between Daask and Boromar</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-us">Why us?</h3>
<p>The group sets out to the inn to prepare for their meeting with Coal and checkout their accommodations. On the way they each talk about their connection to the Sergeant and why they may have been called upon for this task. They seem suspicious that this group was put together for such a task.</p>
<p>Before heading out to meet with Coal they make a stop to do some shopping. Each member purchases a Feather Token.</p>
<div class="admonition magic-item">
<p class="admonition-title">Feather Token</p>
<p><em>Wonderous item, common</em></p>
<p>This small metal disk is inscribed with the image of a feather. When you fall at least 20 feet while the token is on your person, you descend 60 feet per round and take no damage from falling. The token's magic is expended after you land, whereupon the disk becomes nonmagical.</p>

<p>The group travels to High Walls, a district in Lower Tavick's Landing that is completely surrounded by walls and fortified Sharn City Watch checkpoints are at each bridge crossing. The district is home primarily to refugees of the Last War, primarily former warforged soldiers and Cyrans. It is run down and many of the buildings are falling apart. They find their way to the Cog Carnival and to Coal, who is sitting alone at the bar, mostly through bribes.</p>
<p>Initially on edge by the groups approach, Coal begins to calm down when they produce Vilroy's writ of enforcement. She begins to tell the group about the Daask excavation site, the kidnapping of Caden d'Orien, and the murder of her friend Razor. At that moment, an explosion hits the wall just behind Coal's head, assuming that the group has set her up she makes a break for it and a chase ensues.</p>
<p>The group takes off after her, with some pausing to take in the scene and try to figure out who the assailant was. Renée is able to identify that the attacker was a kobold. During the chase, Renée and Cligs keep after the kobold while Cassian, Caelin, and S.A.M. continue after Coal. Renée is eventually able to catch the kobold, with assistance from Clig's <em>message</em>. Likewise, Caelin is able to convince Coal via <em>message</em> to stop running and let them help her.</p>
<p>Renée and Cligs interrogate the kobold, Jerry for information. He informs them that his group received a letter from a higher up in Daask with instructions on where and when to find Coal and to eliminate her. He claims not to know anything else. Cligs also liberates Jerry of his <strong>Wand of Firebolt</strong>.</p>
<div class="admonition magic-item">
<p class="admonition-title">Wand of Firebolt</p>
<p><em>Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)</em></p>
<p>This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 charge to cast <em>Firebolt</em> from it.</p>
<p><strong>Regaining Charges</strong>
The wand regains 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll 1d20). On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.</p>
</div>
<p>Separately, Cassian, Caelin, and S.A.M. catch up and start to talk with Coal. They don't get to talk to her long before the rest of Jerry's hit squad shows up: 3 more kobolds and a shifter named Hound. Combat ensues and S.A.M. quickly dispatches the 3 kobolds with a close range <em>thunderwave</em>. Hound is also quickly eliminated by the trio, with Coal's help.</p>
<p>Renée, Cligs, and Jerry catch up the rest of the group. Jerry, seeing the eviscerated remains of his friends, shares that he doesn't know anything about the excavation site or what is happening there or anything about the child. He tells them that the message was sent to the <strong><em>Whispering Hag Tavern</em></strong> a popular Daask hangout in the Malleon's Gate district of Lower Dura. That the order came from Garra and that Hound has this note in his pocket. Cligs give Coal the decision about Jerry's fate and she quickly dispatches him. She also shares with the group:</p>
<ul>
<li>Razor served with Coal in the Cyran military during the Last War, during which Coal lost her right arm.</li>
<li>Razor and Coal had trouble finding work in Sharn, due to the fact that many businesses are reluctant to hire warforged foreigners. The pair became desperate for money.</li>
<li>A month ago, Razor told Coal she had a job working on a long-term secret mission for Alden d'Orien, the scion of a dragonmarked house. Warforged from other parts of the city were also recruited to help in the task. The job required physical labor, so Coal's injury prevented her from being able to do the job. Razor planned to save money then buy Coal a new arm so she could work with her.</li>
<li>Razor would often come back from work sullen or wounded but never opened up about the job until shortly before she died. Razor confessed that the job was more dangerous than it seemed when she was recruited. Razor was planning to quit before she died.</li>
<li>Coal knew that Razor had been killed or died when she didn't return several days ago.</li>
</ul>
<p>Initially reluctant to go with the group and preferring to leave the city, she finally agrees to accompany them to their debrief with Sergeant Vilroy that evening.</p>
<h3 id="we-want-more-money">We want more money</h3>
<p>The group meets up with Vilroy at the inn she set them up in. They present Coal and share all that has happened, Coal also provides her with all of the information that she shared with group. Realizing that this is much bigger than initially thought, Vilroy encourages the group to keep up the investigation and to meet with Alden d'Orien in the morning and <em>diplomatically</em> question him about his involvement.</p>
<p>The group negotiates an additional 25gp each fee for the continued investigation, along with assistance in getting Coal somewhere safe. Vilroy agrees and the group heads off to bed. Not being at all circumspect about it, Cligs invites Vilroy to her room - she accepts.</p>
<h3 id="confronting-alden">Confronting Alden</h3>
<p>The next morning, before they head out, Renée sends a message to her cousin with the information about the Daask hideout. Additionally, Caelin makes a quick stop to stock up on medicinal herbs on their way. The group heads to Mithral Tower to meet with Alden, who is at his home the Unicorn Estate. The guards are reluctant to let the group in, but they are able to convince them through the potential scandal of the information they have and the writ of enforcement.</p>
<p>Meeting with Alden it is clear the man has seen better days, he appears haggard and not as one would expect someone in his position. He initially tries to brush off their questions but under sustained pressure, he breaks. He reveals that his only son, Caden d'Orien, was kidnapped a month ago. Shortly thereafter he was approached by the half-ogre Garra to supply warforged workers under a House Orien cover for an excavation site in Old Sharn. He was told if he went to the Watch or didn't comply Caden would be killed. At this, he breaks down and runs into the house.</p>
<p>Vishtai, his kalashtar assistant, telepathically encourages the group to save Caden, indicating that House Orien would owe them a great debt for doing so. He also gives them the location and a hint at how to operate the means via which Daask is accessing the dig site.</p>
<h3 id="going-down">Going down?</h3>
<p>The group make their way to the elevator that Vishtai indicated, finding it occupied with two teenage lovers who demand that they leave them at once. They are eventually persuaded to leave the lift without much fuss. The group discovers the secret Medusa panel that Vishtai indicated and Cligs is able to figure out how the mechanism works and they descend into the depths of the city.</p>
<h3 id="masacre-numero-dos">Masacre Numero Dos</h3>
<p>After the extended elevator ride, the group arrives in a massive cavern that is in almost complete darkness. Using their light sources, they are able to identify a 50ft wide, 10ft deep hole in front of them and they hear from across the gaps what sounds like soft sobs of a child.</p>
<p>The group splits into the stealthy and the not-so-stealthy and each make their way around the hole. The not-so group is ambushed by a quartet of Goblin about halfway around the hole. They manage to quickly turn the group in Goblin-goo and continue on their path. Cligs is able to identify that there is a group of the warforged workers being held captive in the center of the hole. The group frees them and goes to rescue Caden. Cassian is able to break the shackles holding him, and having used a crowbar is able to avoid the poison on them that was keeping Caden in his comatose state. Renée is able to rouse him with a Goodberry, she also shares some with the group.</p>
<p>After rescuing all of these people, they learn the following additional details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Garra was the one who was keeping Caden captive and orchestrating the work</li>
<li>It seems that they had found what she was looking for, the ruins of an ancient library and she was able to take a number of books and schema from it.</li>
<li>The work being done, the warforged were ordered to close up the entrance and they were being kept here until the goods were out of the city.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="demanding-restitution">Demanding Restitution</h3>
<p>The group take Caden and a representative of the warforged workers, Anvil, back up to Alden. He is overjoyed to have his son back but doesn't seem that remorseful about the plight of the warforged. He claims to have no knowledge of how they were treated or any deaths that happened. He was trying to keep his son alive. Still, he is persuaded to provide each of the remaining workerss 10gp. He also conveys the following information to the group:</p>
<ul>
<li>Garra is working for someone much higher up in Daask, someone named Niho Koi</li>
<li>He knows that she has recovered what she was looking for in the excavation site and that the items are scheduled to leave Sharn for Droaam via lightning rail.</li>
<li>He gives them the address of hers in Terminus, Lower Tavick's Landing that was the storage location for the goods</li>
<li>He also offers the group a 50gp incentive to keep House Orien out of any report they make to the City Watch. The group successfully convinces him to raise it to 100gp.</li>
<li>They are also given a second Feather Token, this one in the shape of a unicorn head, inscribed with the House Orien sigil.</li>
</ul>
