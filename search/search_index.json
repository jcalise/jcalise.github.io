They find their way to the Cog Carnival and to Coal, who is sitting alone at the bar, mostly through bribes.</p> <p>Initially on edge by the groups approach, Coal begins to calm down when they produce Vilroy's writ of enforcement.

They don't get to talk to her long before the rest of Jerry's hit squad shows up: 3 more kobolds and a shifter named Hound.

They try to catch it but are unsuccessful, so Caelin takes aim with their new crossbow and is able to hit and destroy the device. With both threats eliminated but the Watch closing in, they only have a few moments to examine the body. Cassian is able to determine that this is, unforunately, the man they were supposed to meet, Provost Geldem.

The person leading this group, a well-built dwarf by the same of Sergeant Dolom, doesn't seem to be the best at making connections but it earnest in wanting to understand what has happened ensuring that if the group was involved they are taken into custody. They are able to convince him that they didn't have anything to do with Geldem's death and were attacked by the warforged. He is able to tell them the thing they destroyed after Cutter fell was called a Final Messenger, which is a magic item that warforged can use to send a dying message to a specific person within range. The group also convinces Dolom to allow them to checkout his office with him to see if the item they had given him to look at was stolen.</p> <p>With S.A.M. distracting Dolom, the rest of the group is able to find out the following information:</p> <ul> <li>Using a spell, Caelin is able to see where activity was within the past 30 mins within the office. Bright spots include what appears to be servants setting up the dinner in the office as well as right around his desk. They also see Bonal's fingerprints glowing from Cligs' bag.</li> <li>They snatch up their schema that is sitting out on the desk as well as the notepad that Bonal had been writing notes in</li> <li>Not remembered until later, but Caelin also realizes that there is one extra place setting at the table</li> </ul>"},{"location":"recaps/Session3/#a-cloaked-stranger","title":"A cloaked stranger","text":"<p>Having gotten what they can from Geldem's office and Dolom, the group head off to find a place to review their findings out of the rain and prying eyes. They head to the inn that Cligs works at, the Gray Dragon Inn, and sit down to discuss. Caelin shares what information they saw and they examine the notes Geldem had been making. It seems he had started to examine the schema, making notes about it's composition and properties, but wasn't able to decipher the codeword. Cligs also takes this time to share about taking the journal and they investigate this. It's a small (3x6\") leather-bound journal that has what appears to be mithral threads woven throughout it's cover that converge into what resembles an ancient House Cannith symbol. Inside the pages appear to be blank and made of a special type of paper that isn't quite paper or leather. Cligs also detects what seems like Illusion magic within the journal.</p> <p>As they are discussing what to do next, with S.A.M. suggesting that maybe going to House Cannith is a wise course of action, a cloaked stranger enters the tavern and immediately comes up to them, as if they knew exactly who they were. When they approach the table they show a signet ring on their hand, which is that of House Cannith, and deliver the message: \"If you would know the truth of Bonal Geldem's murder, go to the Broken Anvil tavern in Callestan at Dawn.\" Before anyone can respond or ask questions the stranger leaves. S.A.M. quickly gets us to follow the individual pausing in the doorway. He returns moments later and tells the group he didn't see where the figure went. Caelin is suspicious of S.A.M. behavior and realizes the bard isn't quite telling the full truth about what just happened. Unbeknownst to the group, S.A.M. had sent a Message to the figure.</p>"},{"location":"recaps/Session3/#4-zarantyr","title":"4 Zarantyr","text":""},{"location":"recaps/Session3/#you-know-second-cousin-kro","title":"You know second cousin Kro?","text":"<p>The group makes their way down to Callestan in Lower Dura, a deeply impoverished district of the city known for little City Watch presence and plenty of criminal activity. The Broken Anvil is an oddity in this environment because it is more of an upscale establishment, something you might find in a Middle Ward. As they make their way there in the early hours of the morning they come upon three Goblins blocking their path. It seems that these three Daask members had overheard information at the Broken Anvil about the group and suspects that they might be Boromar operatives. They decide to shake them down for information, and maybe some coin. However, Cligs recognizes their accents as being Darguun goblins from the same city she grew up. The lead goblin, Haraal, says he has a second cousin named Kro and asks Cligs if she knew them from back home. She lies and Haraal believes her. This \"connection\", along with a few silvers to ease the decision, convinces Haraal to let them pass and that they aren't Boromar, he gets permission from his Hobgoblin overseer, who was lurking in the shadows, Eskeen to let them go.</p>"},{"location":"recaps/Session3/#the-aundarian-patron","title":"The Aundarian Patron","text":"<p>Making their way into the tavern they approach the halfling matron of the bar and request a table for 5. As she talks to them she glances down at a sheet of paper and back to them, it appears it may have their descriptions written on it. Recognizing the group, she leads them to a table in the back where human female with delicate features is sitting in clothing and adornment that surely standout in Callestan. As she greets them they notice that she is wearing a House Cannith signet ring as well. In the course of their discussion the group learns:</p> <ul> <li>Her name is Elaydren Vown d'Cannith, from the Aundair Cannith West branch of the family</li> <li>She was the extra person who was going to meet them with Bonal last evening and she learned from the Watch what had happened.</li> <li>Bonal had been helping her locate a family heirloom from a lost Cannith foundry deep below the city</li> <li>She offers them 1,000gp plus 100gp per diem and the favor of her House for recovering the heirloom</li> </ul> <p>When the group accepts, she asks for the journal. When her signet ring is placed on top of the seal on the journal all of the mithral glows brightly and suddenly the journal is filled with text and drawings. She flips to a specific page in the journal and consults it against a map she pulled out of her cloak. After a few moments she reveals the following information:</p> <ul> <li>What they are seeking is an adamantine plate shaped in a seven-pointed star that is roughly hand-sized. It is a schema for an ancient Cannith design but on it's own it has no special power.</li> <li>The lost foundry is 57 levels below Dorasharn Tower's present sewer system. The map will show them the way but first they will need to find the E-213 Valve Cluster to access the Dorasharn sewer system. Beyond that is a sealed door that should take them directly to the foundry.</li> <li>There are other agents of the Lord of Blades about, having destroyed Cutter's final messenger may delay some of them but others will surely be looking for the schema still, and likely the group.</li> <li>She also tells them that Bonal mentioned it would be important to have fire in the sewers but didn't know what for.</li> </ul> <p>Once the deals are set and the group is ready to wrap up, S.A.M. surprises them by giving Elaydren all of the schemas that he was storing that they recovered from Garra (all but the three being held by the other players). She seems grateful for this and hands them to a previously unseen aide. As the group leaves S.A.M. appears to linger behind the rest, ostensibly to give Errana, the halfling hostess, a tip. This raises Caelin's suspicions but they aren't able to determine that anything unusual happened and S.A.M. appears to be completely loyal to Cassian. Unbeknownst to the group, he had sent another secret Message, this one to Elaydren.</p> <p>Before they head down to the sewers and beyond, the group makes a second quick trip to the Bazaar to acquire a bag of holding and 3 Alchemist Fire potions.</p>"}]}
