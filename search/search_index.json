The district is home primarily to refugees of the Last War, primarily former warforged soldiers and Cyrans. It is run down and many of the buildings are falling apart. They find their way to the Cog Carnival and to Coal, who is sitting alone at the bar, mostly through bribes.</p> <p>Initially on edge by the groups approach, Coal begins to calm down when they produce Vilroy's writ of enforcement. She begins to tell the group about the Daask excavation site, the kidnapping of Caden d'Orien, and the murder of her friend Razor. At that moment, an explosion hits the wall just behind Coal's head, assuming that the group has set her up she makes a break for it and a chase ensues.</p> <p>The group takes off after her, with some pausing to take in the scene and try to figure out who the assailant was. Ren\u00e9e is able to identify that the attacker was a kobold. During the chase, Ren\u00e9e and Cligs keep after the kobold while Cassian, Caelin, and S.A.M. continue after Coal. Ren\u00e9e is eventually able to catch the kobold, with assistance from Clig's message. Likewise, Caelin is able to convince Coal via message to stop running and let them help her.</p> <p>Ren\u00e9e and Cligs interrogate the kobold, Jerry for information. He informs them that his group received a letter from a higher up in Daask with instructions on where and when to find Coal and to eliminate her. He claims not to know anything else. Cligs also liberates Jerry of his Wand of Firebolt.</p> <p>Wand of Firebolt</p> <p>Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)</p> <p>This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 charge to cast Firebolt from it.</p> <p>Regaining Charges The wand regains 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll 1d20). On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.</p> <p>Separately, Cassian, Caelin, and S.A.M. catch up and start to talk with Coal. They don't get to talk to her long before the rest of Jerry's hit squad shows up: 3 more kobolds and a shifter named Hound. Combat ensues and S.A.M. quickly dispatches the 3 kobolds with a close range thunderwave. Hound is also quickly eliminated by the trio, with Coal's help.</p> <p>Ren\u00e9e, Cligs, and Jerry catch up the rest of the group. Jerry, seeing the eviscerated remains of his friends, shares that he doesn't know anything about the excavation site or what is happening there or anything about the child. He tells them that the message was sent to the Whispering Hag Tavern a popular Daask hangout in the Malleon's Gate district of Lower Dura. That the order came from Garra and that Hound has this note in his pocket. Cligs give Coal the decision about Jerry's fate and she quickly dispatches him. She also shares with the group:</p> <ul> <li>Razor served with Coal in the Cyran military during the Last War, during which Coal lost her right arm.</li> <li>Razor and Coal had trouble finding work in Sharn, due to the fact that many businesses are reluctant to hire warforged foreigners. The pair became desperate for money.</li> <li>A month ago, Razor told Coal she had a job working on a long-term secret mission for Alden d'Orien, the scion of a dragonmarked house. Warforged from other parts of the city were also recruited to help in the task. The job required physical labor, so Coal's injury prevented her from being able to do the job. Razor planned to save money then buy Coal a new arm so she could work with her.</li> <li>Razor would often come back from work sullen or wounded but never opened up about the job until shortly before she died. Razor confessed that the job was more dangerous than it seemed when she was recruited. Razor was planning to quit before she died.</li> <li>Coal knew that Razor had been killed or died when she didn't return several days ago.</li> </ul> <p>Initially reluctant to go with the group and preferring to leave the city, she finally agrees to accompany them to their debrief with Sergeant Vilroy that evening.</p>"},{"location":"recaps/Session1/#we-want-more-money","title":"We want more money","text":"<p>The group meets up with Vilroy at the inn she set them up in.

The guards are reluctant to let the group in, but they are able to convince them through the potential scandal of the information they have and the writ of enforcement.</p> <p>Meeting with Alden it is clear the man has seen better days, he appears haggard and not as one would expect someone in his position. He initially tries to brush off their questions but under sustained pressure, he breaks. He reveals that his only son, Caden d'Orien, was kidnapped a month ago. Shortly thereafter he was approached by the half-ogre Garra to supply warforged workers under a House Orien cover for an excavation site in Old Sharn. He was told if he went to the Watch or didn't comply Caden would be killed. At this, he breaks down and runs into the house.</p> <p>Vishtai, his kalashtar assistant, telepathically encourages the group to save Caden, indicating that House Orien would owe them a great debt for doing so.
