They find their way to the Cog Carnival and to Coal, who is sitting alone at the bar, mostly through bribes.</p> <p>Initially on edge by the groups approach, Coal begins to calm down when they produce Vilroy's writ of enforcement.

They don't get to talk to her long before the rest of Jerry's hit squad shows up: 3 more kobolds and a shifter named Hound.

They are able to convince him that they didn't have anything to do with Geldem's death and were attacked by the warforged. He is able to tell them the thing they destroyed after Cutter fell was called a Final Messenger, which is a magic item that warforged can use to send a dying message to a specific person within range.

It seems he had started to examine the schema, making notes about it's composition and properties, but wasn't able to decipher the codeword. Cligs also takes this time to share about taking the journal and they investigate this. It's a small (3x6\") leather-bound journal that has what appears to be mithral threads woven throughout it's cover that converge into what resembles an ancient House Cannith symbol. Inside the pages appear to be blank and made of a special type of paper that isn't quite paper or leather.

S.A.M. quickly gets us to follow the individual pausing in the doorway. He returns moments later and tells the group he didn't see where the figure went. Caelin is suspicious of S.A.M. behavior and realizes the bard isn't quite telling the full truth about what just happened.

As they make their way there in the early hours of the morning they come upon three Goblins blocking their path. It seems that these three Daask members had overheard information at the Broken Anvil about the group and suspects that they might be Boromar operatives. They decide to shake them down for information, and maybe some coin. However, Cligs recognizes their accents as being Darguun goblins from the same city she grew up. The lead goblin, Haraal, says he has a second cousin named Kro and asks Cligs if she knew them from back home. She lies and Haraal believes her.

Arriving at Dorasharn Tower the group begins to look for the entrance to the sewers but isn't having much luck. They eventually find a staircase that appears to lead downward, maybe to the sewers? Ultimately they discover it leads to a tailor's shop, the sign above the door reads Nibbur's Fine Tailoring.</p> <p>Nibbur's shop is an oasis of calm in the district. His clothes, though primarily designed for globinoids, are well made and bear a distinctive style - Caelin is even able to pick out some glammerweave amongst some of the nicest outfits on display. They also notice that behind his counter appears to be a large rusted metal door - maybe what they are looking for?</p> <p>They question Nibbur, first complimenting his goods and Cassian even placing an order for a custom set of clothes, which seems to please him and make him more open.

He gives them permission to try and open the door, as long as they are careful with his goods.</p> <p>Cassian is able to force the door open; S.A.M., using his lantern, and Cligs, using her darkvision, inspect the room beyond. It appears to be a large room (roughly 150ft diameter) that is filled with water until about 50ft below them. The smell wafting out is vile and makes Nibbur back away - regretting his choice to let them open it. Looking more carefully they determine that the liquid is more sludge than water and that, suspiciously, the walls appear remarkably clean and free of any kind of grime or fungus. Cligs tosses a scrap piece of fabric into the liquid and notices that it begins to sizzle - not a path they want to take!</p> <p>While examining this room and discussing the outcome, the group hears a loud banging coming down the stairs followed by a massive bugbear shadowing the entrance.

S.A.M. doesn't seem to want to get involved and is ready to leave the goblin to his fate when Nibbur says he might know someone who can help with their issue. Finally they talk to Mandy and are able to convince him to comeback tomorrow, giving Nibbur time to figure out a solution.

The group chooses violence and in short order is able to eliminate Glaive and the two shifters that were working for him. Luckily for the group, they are able to intercept his Final Messenger.
